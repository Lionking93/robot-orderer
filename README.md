# Robot orderer
This is an RPA process for the 'Build robot' course from Robocorp. It reads a .csv file with robot orders and makes orders in https://robotsparebinindustries.com/#/robot-order based on the input data. Output of this process is a list of receipt PDF files that contain details about each order and a picture of the ordered robot.
